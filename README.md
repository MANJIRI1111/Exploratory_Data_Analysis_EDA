# exploratory_Data_Analysis_-EDA-

Key Actions and Technologies: 

1.	Utilized Python and the Pandas Library to construct a Data Frame for data processing, enabling efficient manipulation and analysis of the dataset.
2.	Performed data cleaning by converting object-type columns (such as bathrooms, garage, and HOA) to their appropriate numeric types, ensuring consistency in the dataset.
3.	Addressed missing values through median imputation, preserving the datasetâ€™s structure without distorting central tendencies.
4.	Conducted outlier detection using a combination of boxplots and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, identifying extreme values in the house price distribution.
5.	Generated correlation heatmaps and scatter plots to explore relationships between features such as square footage, bedrooms, lot size, and house price, providing insights into key factors affecting pricing.
6.	Applied Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to create informative visualizations that illustrated the distribution of house prices, relationships between features, and the influence of various factors on price.
7.	Compiled all findings, including visualizations and data processing steps, into a comprehensive PDF report, prepared for handover to the modeling team for further predictive analysis.

Summary: 

 In this project, the primary goal was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a house price dataset. This involved handling missing data, correcting data types, identifying outliner, and generating visualizations to uncover insights into key factors influencing house prices. The cleaned dataset was prepared for further modeling by the data science team, and a detailed report was produced, summarizing the findings and including all relevant plots and charts. The cleaned data and insights will serve as a foundation for future predictive modeling efforts.
